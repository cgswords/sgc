# Scheme Compiler

This is a modified of the P523 compiler to support a more robust runtime system,
including basic garbage collection and printer support (written in Chez Scheme).

- `compiler` is where the magic happens
- `framework` is the course-provided framework
- `runtime` and `runtime2` are runtime constructions
